##Memo To: the coders

##From: Zhi Cheng and Jiayuan Chen

##Subject: Result for the codes 

* 1.
First of all, thanks for the implication of our specification and we are sorry for that you don’t have the experience in Object-Oriented programming with Python. The reason that we want to use python is that if so, the input of the createNewNetwork method would be like the format: [ a:[b,c], b:[c,d,a]....., which will implies the relationship among the towns. For the methods, it would be better if you have a code documentation.

Also, when calling the method createNewNetwork, we want you to create a copy of the the input since in CS3500, we are taught to pay attention to the safety issue. In the specification of CS3500, it always doesn’t mention about the copy but ask students to do that. 

* 2.
No, we chose to use Python as our language for client module while the server is written in Java. We are not able to integrate the code. Also, we assume the value in the dictionary is list of towns, and we based on that to complete our client module while their value is list of String.

* 3.
In the future, I will explained more specifically about the requirements like need a copy, the input of methods, how to handle kinds of error....
