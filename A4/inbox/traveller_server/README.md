Our specification asked for a Traveller Server Implementation in Python 3.6, but after some deliberation we decided to implement it in Java 8.
Unfortunatley, our team does not have any experience in Object-Oriented programming with Python, and we lacked the time to get our team up to 
speed and implement the code by the deadline. Luckily, Java has a Dictionary type that we could use to adequatley meet the specification given to us.
