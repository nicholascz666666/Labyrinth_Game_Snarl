Instruction to run the game:
The game requires an X session to display a GUI.

To run the game, simply run command ./localSnarl to start the game.

The game only support one player now.
When the game is started, the player is required to enter their name in the terminal.
When it is the player's turn, it is required to first input the row number and then the col num to move the player.
Both row and column numbers are absolute position. If the input is not numeric value, the game will break. The functionality of using terminal to move is temporary, it will be using mouse to move in the future.

The player is always located in the center of the screen, even though it is not drawn in the player's view. 
The green circle represents the key, and the blue circle represents the exit.
